Q2 
2.1 cat /proc/cpuinfo
Processor :  Provides each processor with an identifying number. It starts with 0. If there are 4 processors, Processor fiels will show numbers from (0 - 3)
CPU Cores - Number of cores in each physical processor.
2.2 How many CPU sockets, cores, and processors does your machine have?
CPU Sockets : 1
CPU Cores : 2 
Processors : 0-3

2.3 What is the frequency of each processor?
Processor 0 : 800.000 MHz
Processor 1 : 1417.015 MHz
Processor 2 : 798.203 MHz
Processor 3 : 1428.172 MHz

2.4 How much memory does your machine have?
We can use /proc/meminfo 
Total Memory : 3921828 kB
Free Memory : 308924 kB
Available Memory : 1128016 kB
Difference between Free and Available Memory : 819092 kB


2.4 What is the total number of user-level processes in the system?
Do cat /proc/stat (Explained here: https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk65143)
First line "cpu" aggregates all the values from other cpus
Total number of user-level processes in the system : 225961

2.5 What is the total number of number of forks since the boot in the system ?
The "processes" line  from "cat /proc/stat" gives the number of processes and threads created, which includes (but is not limited to) those created by calls to the fork() and clone() system calls.
the total number of number of forks since the boot in the system : 11848

2.6 How many context switches has the system performed since bootup?
The "ctxt" line "cat /proc/stat" gives the total number of context switches across all CPUs.
Total context switches : 20622872

Q3
PID of the process running the cpu command : 20931
CPU consumed :100% Memory Consumed :0%
Current State of the process is: Running(R)
